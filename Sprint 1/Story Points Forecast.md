### Rationale behind the forecast:-
We considered to commence the development of the Adventure Web Application with the profile management Epic. Below are the reasons for coosing the above User Stories and Story Points in Sprint 1:
1. In order to develop the core features of the Application, implementing the profile management features is a priority.
2. The predominant components of the features built in Sprint-1 are utilized for the development of the latter features such as, creating a matching algorithm based on the information that user provides in the profile.
3. To ensure data security pertaining to the user's information and privacy, we chose to implement data encryption in this Sprint.
4. As the user will be able to develop better connections and find matching adventure partners, we created a means of connecting the user's profile to social media platforms. This brings-in better marketing of the Adventure Application as a whole.
5. As having a profile is an imperative aspect to further showcase the application features to the stakeholders, we included create, update and delete features of the profile.
