## Daily Scrum
The team synchronizes everyday for a 15-minutes call to discuss on what has been acheived in the last 24 hours, what needs to be done in the next 24 hours, and if any of the team members have any burning issues to be discussed or any hindrance to the development. So that, as a team we can work towards resolving the issues. The team has access to the Kanban Board, where each of the members can check their ongoing and future tasks of development.

#### 1. What has been done in the last 24 hours?
We share the Kanban Board and discuss the work in progress. Below is the explication of each of the Team Member in the group:
Pratusha Raya- I could resolve the encryption problem that I was facing earlier. It was due to the an issue with the encryption key. I further developed a code module for the User's password update feature and tested it.
Jobair Hossain- I am developing social media module to connect the User's profile to Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. 
Santhiya Subramanian- I created User profile history table and could store the updated profile information as part of this table.
Kavya Vallapureddy- I listed the User's adventure interests and am now displaying them as part of UI.
Ebot Tabi- I updated the database to store the profile picture and other images uploaded by the User.
