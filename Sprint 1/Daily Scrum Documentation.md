## Daily Scrum
The team synchronizes everyday for a 15-minutes call to discuss on what has been acheived in the last 24 hours, what needs to be done in the next 24 hours, and if any of the team members have any burning issues to be discussed or any hindrance to the development. So that, as a team we can work towards resolving the issues. The team has access to the Kanban Board, where each of the members can check their ongoing and future tasks of development.

#### 1. What has been done in the last 24 hours?
We share the Kanban Board and discuss the work in progress. Below is the explication of each of the Team Member in the group:
Pratusha Raya- I could resolve the encryption problem that I was facing earlier. It was due to an issue with the encryption key. I further developed a code module for the User's password update feature and tested it.
Jobair Hossain- I am developing social media module to connect the User's profile to Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. 
Santhiya Subramanian- I created User profile history table and could store the updated profile information as part of this table.
Kavya Vallapureddy- I listed the User's adventure interests and am now displaying them as part of UI.
Ebot Tabi- I updated the database to store the profile picture and other images, uploaded by the User.

#### 2. What will I do in the next 24 hours?
Kanban Board helped us decide on the next set of tasks to be achieved. Below are the responses provided by the team members:
Jobair Hossain- Complete the development social media connectivity for Twitter and write unit test cases.
Pratusha Raya- I shall test the entire Registration and Login modules with the available set of test cases.
Kavya Vallapureddy- I shall create automation suite for adventure interests module.
Santhiya Subramanian- I shall finish the development for User's profile deletion and proceed with testing.
Ebot Tabi- Will create automation suite for uploading pictures in a profile.

#### 3. What are the anticipated hindrance aspects?
We discussed about two predominant impediments as part of the meeting:
a. As each of the team member is progressing towards testing phase for their respective module, if any major defects are found as part of testing then, the overall development timelines might be at risk. This eventually could cause features spillover.
b. During code integration, if the team faces challenges or observe bugs which lead to code changes, the Sprint #1 development might be delayed.

#### 4. What steps are being taken to overcome the hindrance?
To address the highlighted risks, the team came-up with the following plan:
a. The team members shall discuss and take the required assistance within the team, if they observe considerable issues. This should be done during the early stages of the testing phase. So that, the bug fixes do not cause obstruction to meet the Sprint #1 development goals.
b. Quick and timely checks shall be done by each team member to avoid integration issues.
