## Rationale behind chosing Behavior Driven Development for our project

#### What is BDD: 

Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is an integration and improvement of Test Driven Development (TDD) and Acceptance Test-Drivenâ€¯Development (ATDD) approaches. It stands out because it is written in a common language, which facilitates communication between technical and non-technical teams, as well as stakeholders. Tests are developed prior to coding in both the approaches however, BDD tests are more user-focused and based on the system's behavior. BDD will aid by encouraging cross-functional collaboration to develop a shared knowledge of the problem to be solved and work with short and quick iterations to increase feedback and value flow.

#### Rationale: 

- The team should produce a MVP in every sprint because we adopted agile methodology to build the application. When tests are automated, they verify that the system continues to behave as expected even as it evolves. As a result, Release on Demand is possible.  
- Automated BDD tests can also be used to replace other types of behavioral requirements as the definitive assertion for as-built system behavior. 
- It provides us with a platform to work independently with various technologies such as Java, Python, etc. 
- The simple notion of layman text in the form of a feature file enables technical resource stakeholders to construct scenarios in Gherkin language utilizing user stories. Plain text compatibility aids in achieving maximum coverage during testing. 
- We chose the BDD framework for testing the application because of the advantages listed above. Many tools, including cucumber, JUnit, Parasoft, etc., are supported by BDD. Cucumber will typically execute acceptance tests written in JUnit or TestNG, which could be functional or Selenium UI tests. Each step includes a definition that converts the statement to some code, and features are written in Gherkin. In addition, our team members prior experience with cucumber is an add on atrribute.
