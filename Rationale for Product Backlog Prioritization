# Rationale for Product Backlog Prioritization

Rationale: After discussing among the team members, we understand the product backlogs. We later defined possible product backlogs by following the software development life cycle followed by prioritizing the backlogs. We attempted to find whether the prioritization would follow the SDLC process, or it can be prioritized differently! After discussing further, we decided to prioritize based on the overall process that initiates with requirements analysis followed by design, development, and testing respectively. In each phase, we categorized items based on priority groups: must have, should have, and could have that reflect high, medium, and low priority respectively
