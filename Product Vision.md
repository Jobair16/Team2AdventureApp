4. Software Tester
5. Product Owner
6. Adventures
7. Investors
8. Professor and
9. Vendor

## Near Vision (related to MVP): 
Bring together and help connect all the adventurers of the planet and give an experience of finding a perfect co-adventurer as rip-roaring as the adventure itself.

## Far Vision: 
Far vision can have multiple goals in-line with the product. Below are some of the aspects of our far vision:
1. The team shall create a platform where like-minded adventurers can group up and go on adventures.
2. The adventurers can act as guides to the enthusiasts and provide recommendations about the adventures they did.
3. A section shall be provided for the adventurers to create posts or attach any media. The most viewed posts shall appear in the trending list.
4. Third-party businesses including adventure equipment sellers, hotels and commute facilitators (flight, trains, tour buses) shall advertise in the web application.
