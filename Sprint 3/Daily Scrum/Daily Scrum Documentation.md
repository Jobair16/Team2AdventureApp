## Daily Scrum
The team synchronizes everyday for a 15-minutes call to discuss on what has been acheived in the last 24 hours, what needs to be done in the next 24 hours, and if any of the team members have any burning issues to be discussed or any hindrance to the development. So that, as a team we can work towards resolving the issues. The team has access to the Kanban Board, where each of the members can check their ongoing and future tasks of development.

#### 1. What has been done in the last 24 hours?
We share the Kanban Board and discuss the work in progress. Below is the explication of each of the Team Member in the group:
Pratusha Raya- I worked on the user interfance changes of the adventurer details. I tried to focus on the RWD (Responsive Web Design) compliance aspect of it.
Jobair Hossain- I resolved the database fetch issue that I was facing after the user clicks on the view link. 
Santhiya Subramanian- I embeded video calling option against a co-adventurer.
Kavya Vallapureddy- I worked on database data deletion of the features that the admin deletes.
Ebot Tabi- I finished developing the code to terminate the adventurer account.

#### 2. What will I do in the next 24 hours?
Kanban Board helped us decide on the next set of tasks to be achieved. Below are the responses provided by the team members:
Jobair Hossain- I shall finish the development of view adventures list tasks.
Pratusha Raya- I will test the end-to-end functionality of the view adventurer details and fix issues, if any.
Kavya Vallapureddy- I shall write unit test cases for my backlog and start testing the features.
Santhiya Subramanian- I shall finish the development the development of video calling option.
Ebot Tabi- Will create automation suite for the Sprint#3 backlogs.

#### 3. What are the anticipated hindrance aspects?
We discussed about two predominant impediments as part of the meeting:
a. As each of the team member is progressing towards testing phase for their respective module, if any major defects are found as part of testing then, the overall development timelines might be at risk. This eventually could cause features spillover.
b. During code integration, if the team faces challenges or observe bugs which lead to code changes, the Sprint #1 development might be delayed.

#### 4. What steps are being taken to overcome the hindrance?
To address the highlighted risks, the team came-up with the following plan:
a. The team members shall discuss and take the required assistance within the team, if they observe considerable issues. This should be done during the early stages of the testing phase. So that, the bug fixes do not cause obstruction to meet the Sprint #1 development goals.
b. Quick and timely checks shall be done by each team member to avoid integration issues.
