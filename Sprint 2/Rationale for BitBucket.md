#### Choosing the right repository hosting service is a crucial step in any development project. Hosting your code is an important task that affects your productivity. As a result, finding the correct repository hosting services might be difficult because it affects the development team's productivity.
Github and Bitbucket are hosting systems that provide access to public and private repositories for developers. Bitbucket and GitHub are fairly similar in terms of functionality, and both allow you to execute fundamental tasks like:

•	Repositories can be created and managed.
•	Using a Two-Factor Authentication System (2FA)
•	submit pull requests.
•	Conduct code reviews.
•	Enhances team cooperation and process efficiency.
•	Make use of Markdown support and inline editing.
•	Keep note of issues, problems, and so on.

#### The following are the reasons we chose Bitbucket for our project:

•	It's a lot easier to integrate with other DevOps tools now (like Jenkins, Jira)
•	Code compliance and security requirements are effectively managed.
•	Adaptable to a variety of operating systems.
•	Instead of only looking for variable names, Bitbucket will let us search our syntax for definitions that match our query.
•	It allows the user to build their own personal account by registering on an official web browser.
•	Bitbucket now provides teachers and students with unlimited private repositories for free.
•	Smaller teams and robust query management systems are welcome.
•	Create authentication for social media assistance, and so forth.

#### Because we use Jira for project management, Bitbucket will allow us to link to Jira and track the team's CI/CD.
