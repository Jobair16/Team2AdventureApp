## Daily Scrum
The team synchronizes everyday for a 15-minutes call to discuss on what has been acheived in the last 24 hours, what needs to be done in the next 24 hours, and if any of the team members have any burning issues to be discussed or any hindrance to the development. So that, as a team we can work towards resolving the issues. The team has access to the Kanban Board, where each of the members can check their ongoing and future tasks of development.

#### 1. What has been done in the last 24 hours?
We share the Kanban Board and discuss the work in progress. Below is the explication of each of the Team Member in the group:
Pratusha Raya- I tested the end-to-end functionality of the matching algorithm based on the decided factors. I further added places of interest, to be part of the matching algorithm.
Jobair Hossain- I tested the profile connectivity to Facebook. I was checking if the user can be provided an option to default post in the social media profiles, everytime a post is made. 
Santhiya Subramanian- I made database changes, to not show the blocked profiles in the find profile list of the user.
Kavya Vallapureddy- I am working on the user interface changes to enable message history deletion.
Ebot Tabi- I updated the content which is being sent as part of the push notification and tested for the changes.

#### 2. What will I do in the next 24 hours?
Kanban Board helped us decide on the next set of tasks to be achieved. Below are the responses provided by the team members:
Jobair Hossain- I shall write unit test cases update the BDD document as per the status. I shall work on the issues, if encountered.
Pratusha Raya- I shall work on the code module to remove the disliked profiles from the matching profiles list.
Kavya Vallapureddy- I shall test the end-to-end functionality of view and delete message history.
Santhiya Subramanian- I shall create automation suite for sending message functionality of the user.
Ebot Tabi- I shall implement the email validations to send notifications.

#### 3. What are the anticipated hindrance aspects?
We discussed about two predominant impediments as part of the meeting:
a. As each of the team member is progressing towards testing phase for their respective module, if any major defects are found as part of testing then, the overall development timelines might be at risk. This eventually could cause features spillover.
b. During code integration, if the team faces challenges or observe bugs which lead to code changes, the Sprint #1 development might be delayed.

#### 4. What steps are being taken to overcome the hindrance?
To address the highlighted risks, the team came-up with the following plan:
a. The team members shall discuss and take the required assistance within the team, if they observe considerable issues. This should be done during the early stages of the testing phase. So that, the bug fixes do not cause obstruction to meet the Sprint #2 development goals.
b. Quick and timely checks shall be done by each team member to avoid integration issues.
